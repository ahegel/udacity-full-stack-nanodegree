# Portfolio Website
This is a responsive portfolio website modeled after a design mockup image.

I created this site as part of the Udacity [Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004).

## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
